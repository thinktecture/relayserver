## Version 2.0.0-beta

* Multi-Server operation

  * It is now possible to operate multiple Relay servers in parallel for better load distribution. All servers need to have access to a shared network folder in order to exchange binary files with request or response payloads.

* Improved connection stability with new On-Premises connectors

  * The Relay server is now capable of heart beating On-Premises connectors of version 2.x or newer. A connector that does not receive this heartbeat will automatically try to reconnect to the server.

* Implementation of custom code

  * It is now possible to extend the Relay server with custom WebAPI controllers as well as as plugins to react upon or even modify incoming requests or outgoing responses. For details see [RelayServer Plugin Development](5-relayserver-interceptor-development.md).  

    We offer the following extension points:

    * Requests

      * Read or modify the HTTP verb
      * Read or modify the requested url
      * Read or modify the HTTP headers
      * Immidiate rejection of answering of the request
      * Modifying the TTL of the request in the message queue
      * Modification of the acknowlegde-mode to automatic or manual acknowledgement of the request in the message queue

    * Responses

      * Read or modify the HTTP status code
      * Read or modify the response HTTP headers
      * Complete replacement of the received response

- Improved logging

  * We switched the logging from NLog to Serilog and enriched the log entries with structured information. You can configure custom sinks and enrichers as you see the need. For configuration details see [Serilog AppSettings Konfiguration](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/AppSettings).

- Optimizations

  * Memory consumption of the Relay server and On-Premises connectors has been reduced. Additionally we optimized general performance to make the system more efficient.

- Security improvements

  * It is now possible to deactivate features of the Relay server (Relaying, On Premises connections, Management Web) specifically. Also, when enabled, it is possible to allow access globally or only from localhost.
  * All dashboard and info endpoints now require authorization
  * Error messages do not contain stack traces anymore
  * Changing a users password now requires the current password
  * Rules for better passwords have been introduced
  * Too many failed attempts to login will now temporary lock a users account
  * Strict Transport Security headers will be set
  * X-Frame-Options headers will be set
  * X-XSS-Protection headers will be set
  * It ist now possible to restrict the relay endpoint to authenticated requests only

- General improvements

  * Info and management endpoints now set correct cache headers
  * Dependencies have been updated to their corresponding latest versions

- Bug fixes

  * Some operations did not work reliable in the Management Web and have been fixed
